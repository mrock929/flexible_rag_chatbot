What is the her2-neu gene?,"factuality:The HER-2/neu gene is a member of the erbB-like oncogene family and is related to, but distinct from, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The gene is significant in the context of breast cancer."
What is the her2-neu gene?,"icontains-all:her-2/neu, gene, breast, cancer"
Summarize this article in plain language,"factuality:The article discusses the HER-2/neu oncogene. Researchers studied this gene in 189 cases of breast cancer and found that it was often amplified, meaning there were higher amounts of it in the tumors. This means that the HER-2/neu gene could be used to predict if breast cancer will get significantly worse."

What are the most important takeaways from this article?,"factuality:Alterations of the HER-2/neu gene were investigated in 189 primary human breast cancers, where it was found to be amplified in 30% of the tumors. Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene is a significant predictor of overall survival and time to relapse in breast cancer patients. The significance of HER-2/neu amplification as a prognostic factor remains even after accounting for other known prognostic factors. HER-2/neu amplification offers greater prognostic value than most currently used prognostic factors, including hormonal-receptor status, particularly in lymph node-positive breast cancer."

What is the relationship between the HER-2/neu gene and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)?,"factuality:The HER-2/neu gene is closely related to, the EGFR gene. Both genes belong to the tyrosine kinase family, but HER-2/neu is located on chromosome 17, whereas EGFR is located on chromosome 7."

What prognostic significance does the amplification of the HER-2/neu gene have in breast cancer?,"factuality:Amplification of the HER-2/neu gene was found to be a significant predictor of both overall survival and time to relapse in breast cancer patients. It remained significant even after adjusting for other known prognostic factors and had greater prognostic value than most currently used factors."
What prognostic significance does the amplification of the HER-2/neu gene have in breast cancer?,"icontains-all:survival, time to relapse, prognostic"
What factors were evaluated in the breast cancer study to assess the prognosis of patients?,"factuality:The factors evaluated in the study included the size of the primary tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, age of patient, and the number and status of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease."
What factors were evaluated in the breast cancer study to assess the prognosis of patients?,"icontains-all:size, tumor, stage, disease, hormonal receptor, age, axillary lymph, status"
What was the correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and the number of positive lymph nodes in the study?,"factuality:The study found a trend showing a higher incidence of HER-2/neu gene amplification in patients with more than three positive axillary lymph nodes."
What was the correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and the number of positive lymph nodes in the study?,"icontains-all:amplification, positive, nodes"
What was the significance of HER-2/neu gene amplification in predicting relapse and survival in node-positive breast cancer patients?,"factuality:HER-2/neu gene amplification was found to have a strong and statistically significant correlation with both time to disease relapse and overall survival. Amplification of the gene was superior to most other prognostic factors in predicting patient outcomes."
What was the significance of HER-2/neu gene amplification in predicting relapse and survival in node-positive breast cancer patients?,"icontains-all:amplification, relapse, survival, prognostic"
What were the findings regarding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification and rearrangement in breast cancer samples?,"factuality:Amplification of the EGFR gene was found in only 2% of the breast cancer samples, and rearrangement of the EGFR gene was observed in one of the cases. The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was too small to perform statistical correlation."
What were the findings regarding the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification and rearrangement in breast cancer samples?,"icontains-all:EGFR, 2%, breast cancer, rearrangement"
"What role does HER-2/neu gene amplification play in breast cancer prognosis, and how does it compare to other prognostic factors?","factuality:HER-2/neu gene amplification is a significant predictor of overall survival and time to relapse in node-positive breast cancer patients. HER-2/neu amplification has greater prognostic value than most currently used factors, and is as important as the number of positive lymph nodes, which is the best-known prognostic factor."

What is the potential significance of HER-2/neu amplification in breast cancer pathogenesis and how does it relate to other proto-oncogenes like N-myc?,"factuality:HER-2/neu amplification may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, similar to how N-myc amplification is implicated in neuroblastoma. Like N-myc, greater amplification of HER-2/neu is associated with worse prognosis."
